## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a product team member, I want to understand how users interact with our travel management application so that I can make data-driven decisions about feature improvements and user experience optimization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user navigates through the application, **When** they perform actions like viewing trips, adding flights, or using the concierge feature, **Then** these interactions are automatically tracked and sent to PostHog analytics platform
2. **Given** the analytics system is active, **When** the product team accesses PostHog dashboard, **Then** they can view real-time user behavior data, page views, and feature usage statistics
3. **Given** a user performs travel-related actions, **When** events are captured, **Then** the data includes relevant context like trip details, user preferences, and feature engagement patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users have disabled JavaScript or use ad blockers?
- How does the system handle analytics tracking in offline scenarios?
- What occurs when PostHog service is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically capture user page views and navigation events throughout the application
- **FR-002**: System MUST track key user interactions including trip creation, flight additions, accommodation bookings, and concierge feature usage
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify and track unique user sessions to understand user journey patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture custom events for travel-specific actions like itinerary modifications, pending issue resolutions, and member management
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide feature flag capabilities to enable controlled rollouts of new features
- **FR-006**: System MUST respect user privacy preferences and comply with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific privacy regulations - GDPR, CCPA, etc.]
- **FR-007**: System MUST track performance metrics to identify slow-loading pages or features
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow filtering and segmentation of data by user type, travel category, or feature usage
- **FR-009**: Analytics data MUST be retained for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific retention period not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide real-time event tracking without significantly impacting application performance

### Key Entities
- **User Session**: Represents a unique user's interaction period with the application, including session duration and page sequence
- **Event**: Individual user actions or system occurrences that provide insight into feature usage and user behavior
- **Feature Flag**: Configuration toggles that allow controlled feature rollouts and A/B testing capabilities
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Centralized view of collected data providing insights into user behavior patterns and application performance
- **User Identifier**: Anonymous or identified user tracking that respects privacy while enabling user journey analysis
