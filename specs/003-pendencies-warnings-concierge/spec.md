# Feature Specification: Dependencies Warnings & Concierge Pending Issues System

**Feature Branch**: `003-pendencies-warnings-concierge`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "pendencies warnings concierge - TODO Feature de pendencias - deve exibir oq t√° faltando pra preencher em cada aba por exemplo - falta gente preencher o VOO Falta acomoda√ß√£o pra algum dia de viagem que ficou descoberto Pendencias feature - Concierge Sem eventos adicionados ainda - quer que eu sugira alguns eventos para a sua viagem ? Perhaps instead of the ready-made messages it has now, create a system of pending issues, where the concierge will say what is missing. For example, if someone doesn't have a specified flight yet, the person can say, Hey, Lucas Paulo hasn't entered any flights, do you want me to add a flight for him? Hey, I see here that there's missing stay coverage in the Gestalt, do you want me to create something like that? And then there's no need to call LLM, it would be something static that would be displayed on the concierge's screen, directly in the chat. And when there are these pending issues, show a blink signal in the top menu of the concierge. When I'm on the calendar itinerary or schedule itinerary, when I click on the flight event, it will bring up the modal. In that modal, there should be a link that will redirect me to the flights tab, passing the ID of that specific flight. And when that happens, the expectation is that The flight itself should be highlighted on that screen, differentiating it from the others. If the person clicked on that modal to go to that specific flight."

3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Identified several areas needing clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: User flow for discovering and resolving pending issues
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Travel entities and pending issue types
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - Several [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a travel organizer, I want to easily identify what information is missing from my travel plan so I can quickly complete my itinerary without having to manually check each tab and section for incomplete data.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have a travel plan with missing flight information for a traveler, **When** I open the concierge chat, **Then** I see a static message indicating which traveler is missing flight details and offering to help add them
2. **Given** I have incomplete accommodation coverage for specific dates, **When** I view the concierge, **Then** I see a warning about uncovered dates and an offer to help resolve the gap
3. **Given** there are pending issues in my travel plan, **When** I navigate to any page, **Then** I see a blinking indicator in the concierge menu item
4. **Given** I have no events added to my itinerary, **When** I check the concierge, **Then** I see a suggestion to add events to my travel plan

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple travelers have the same type of missing information?
- How does the system handle when there are no pending issues to display?
- How are pending issues prioritized when there are many different types?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze travel plans and identify both absent and incomplete required information across flights and accommodations, plus optional event suggestions
- **FR-002**: System MUST display static pending issue messages in the concierge chat without requiring LLM processing, prioritized with critical issues (flights/accommodations) before optional ones (events)
- **FR-003**: System MUST show personalized pending issue messages that identify specific travelers and missing information types, grouping multiple travelers with the same issue type into single messages
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a visual indicator (blinking signal) in the concierge menu when pending issues exist
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect accommodation coverage gaps by analyzing travel dates against booked stay periods, requiring same-day check-in/check-out with no gaps allowed
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify travelers who haven't entered flight information
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect when no events have been added to the travel itinerary and offer optional suggestions
- **FR-010**: System MUST offer actionable assistance for each type of pending issue detected
- **FR-011**: System MUST update pending issues in real-time as users complete missing information
- **FR-012**: System MUST remove pending issue messages once the corresponding data is added

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Pending Issue**: Represents a specific missing piece of travel information, includes type (flight, accommodation, event), affected traveler(s), description, and resolution action
- **Travel Coverage Gap**: Represents periods of travel dates without corresponding accommodation bookings
- **Flight Event Reference**: Links between itinerary flight events and detailed flight records for navigation purposes

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: What should be considered **required** vs **optional** travel components for pending issue detection? ‚Üí A: Only flights and accommodations are required; events are optional suggestions
- Q: What constitutes "missing" information that should trigger pending issue warnings? ‚Üí A: Both absent and incomplete data (flight exists but missing details like seat, gate)
- Q: How should pending issues be ordered when multiple types exist simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Critical first (missing flights/accommodations), then optional (events)
- Q: What defines adequate accommodation coverage for travel dates? ‚Üí A: Same-day check-in/check-out required (no gaps allowed)
- Q: How should multiple pending issues of the same type be displayed in the concierge chat? ‚Üí A: Group into single message: "3 travelers missing flights"

## Clarifications Needed

### User Experience
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What visual design should the blinking indicator use?]** - Frequency, color, and style of the blinking animation

### Business Logic
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there different traveler roles with different requirements?]** - Do all travelers need the same information, or do some roles have different requirements?
