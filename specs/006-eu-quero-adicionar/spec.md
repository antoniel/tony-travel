**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Eu quero adicionar i18n no app - see @https://github.com/juliomuhlbauer/tanstack-router-i18n-paraglide"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Request: Add internationalization support to the travel app
2. Extract key concepts from description

   ‚Üí Actions: View content in preferred language, switch languages
   ‚Üí Data: Translated UI labels, messages, date/time formats, currency
   ‚Üí Constraints: SEO-friendly URLs, maintain existing functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí (All major ambiguities resolved)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User views app in their preferred language
   ‚Üí User switches between languages
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Language detection, switching, URL structure, content translation
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Language/Locale settings, Translated content

   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - language support scope needs definition"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: What should be the default language and which additional languages should be supported in the initial release? ‚Üí A: Portuguese (pt-BR) as default + English (en)
- Q: Should user-generated content (travel names, descriptions, notes, activities) support multiple language versions? ‚Üí A: No - Keep original language only
- Q: How should language preferences be persisted across user sessions? ‚Üí A: Browser storage only (localStorage/cookies, works for all users)
- Q: When UI translations are missing or incomplete for a message, what should the system display? ‚Üí A: Show Portuguese (default language) text as fallback, with warning in developer mode
- Q: Is right-to-left (RTL) text direction support required for languages like Arabic or Hebrew? ‚Üí A: No - Only LTR languages (pt-BR, en) for now

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an international traveler, I want to view and interact with the travel planning app in my preferred language, so that I can comfortably use all features without language barriers.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the app for the first time, **When** the app loads, **Then** the content should be displayed in their browser's preferred language (if supported) or the default language

2. **Given** a user is viewing the app in one language, **When** they select a different language from the language switcher, **Then** all UI elements, labels, and messages should immediately update to the selected language

3. **Given** a user has selected a preferred language, **When** they share a URL with another user, **Then** the URL should reflect the language preference and display the same content in that language for the recipient

4. **Given** a user is viewing a travel itinerary, **When** they switch languages, **Then** dates, times, and currency should be formatted according to the selected locale's conventions

5. **Given** a user navigates to a URL with a language prefix (e.g., /pt/trip/123), **When** the page loads, **Then** all content should display in Portuguese

6. **Given** a user is on the default language version (no language prefix in URL), **When** they navigate to any page, **Then** the app should maintain the default language without prefixes in the URL

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's browser language is not supported by the app?
  - System should fall back to the default language
- How does the system handle partially translated content?
  - System falls back to Portuguese (default language) text when translations are missing; developer mode shows console warnings for missing translations

- What happens when a user manually edits the URL to include an unsupported language code?
  - System should redirect to the same page without the language prefix (default language)

- How are language preferences persisted across sessions?
  - Language preference saved in browser storage (localStorage) and persists across sessions on the same device/browser

- What happens to SEO metadata (title, description) when language changes?
  - All SEO tags should be translated and include proper hreflang attributes for search engines

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and display content in the user's browser preferred language if supported, otherwise use the default language

- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a visible language switcher component accessible from any page

- **FR-003**: System MUST support Portuguese (pt-BR) as the default language and English (en) as an additional language

- **FR-004**: System MUST generate SEO-friendly URLs with optional language prefixes (e.g., /en/about, /pt/sobre, or /about for default)

- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the current page and its parameters when switching languages (e.g., switching from /en/trip/123 to /pt/trip/123)

- **FR-006**: System MUST format dates, times, and numbers according to the selected locale's conventions

- **FR-007**: System MUST translate all UI labels, buttons, form fields, error messages, and system notifications

- **FR-008**: System MUST provide appropriate hreflang tags and canonical URLs for search engine optimization

- **FR-009**: System MUST persist user's language preference in browser storage (localStorage) and maintain it across sessions on the same device and browser

- **FR-010**: System MUST support left-to-right (LTR) text direction for Portuguese and English; RTL support is out of scope for this release

- **FR-011**: System MUST allow the default language URLs to remain clean without language prefixes (e.g., /about instead of /en/about)

- **FR-012**: System MUST redirect invalid language codes in URLs to the equivalent page in the default language

- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain language consistency across navigation, including deep links and shared URLs

- **FR-014**: User-generated content (travel names, notes, activities) MUST remain in the original language entered by users and MUST NOT be translated or support multiple language versions

- **FR-015**: System MUST fall back to Portuguese (default language) text when translations are missing or incomplete, and MUST log warnings in development mode to alert developers of missing translations

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Locale/Language**: Represents a supported language and regional variant
  - Attributes: Language code ('pt-BR' or 'en'), language name, text direction (always LTR), default status (pt-BR is default)
  - Relationships: Associated with user preferences, URL patterns, and translated content

- **Translation/Message**: Represents translated text for UI elements
  - Attributes: Message key/identifier, translated text per supported locale, fallback text
  - Relationships: Linked to specific locale, organized by feature/module

- **User Language Preference**: Represents a user's selected language stored in browser
  - Attributes: Preferred locale code, last updated timestamp
  - Relationships: Stored in browser localStorage, independent of user account
